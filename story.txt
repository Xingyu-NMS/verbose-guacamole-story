Our charactor is a old man named Rick, a crazy scientist who travel through realities with his grandkid, Morty, and engage in all sorts of bizarre adventures.
Rick first arrived right infront of a huge lake and then he went to the bottom of the lake. And surprisingly, hefound a lot of golds anfd silvers at that place.
Rick was very excited to come across this fortune. But a few moments later,
thousands of snakes started to come from the depths of the lake. As they were
trying to excape, one of the snakes bit Morty!
Morty started to puff up very quickly, as the snakes were poisonous! Rick grabbed Morty by his feet and dragged him into his spaceship. Rick quickly deduced, with his
IQ of over 500, that this poison was extraterrestrial and he needed to take Morty somewhere in the future in order to cure him. However, they were running out of time.
Morty's puffiness was slowly starting to reach his brain, and he started to act really dumb because of it.
Rick knew he is running out of options, so he tried all his best to embed an idea in his mind: I will invent time travel to save my grandkid's dumb ass. And outta no where, a Rick from the future appeared and gave him the antidote.
Morty was saved, but Rick know it's not done yet: one day in the future, he will have to spend a entire weekend and invent time travel technology to actually save Morty.
